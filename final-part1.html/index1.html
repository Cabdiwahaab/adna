				My goal is to work as a computer programmer, and to that end<br> I am studying Computer Science at Saint Paul College,scheduled for graduation in the Spring of 2021.<br> 
				Since graduating from High School in Ethiopia and moving to the US,
				<br>I have been working as a driver and in retail, and I am looking forward to a meaningful work as a programmer.
				<br>I am particularly interested in web development and I know HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.<br>
				Growing up in Somalia and Ethiopia made me appreciate all that I can achieve in the United States, 
				<br>through hard work and education. <br>
				I bring that dedication to everything that I do and work hard to be a collaborative employee.<br>
				In my leisure time, I like to help my family, play with my children and take them to the fun places. 
				<br>Beside this I like to watch boxing game and watch moves. 
				<br>I like to hang out with my friends and visit some of my relatives.
				<br> Having a good connection with the relatives is very crucial in our culture.
				<h6 style="color:#ff0000">Three Things</h6>
				<h6 style="color:blue">Quick-Learner.</h6> My employers have told me that I am a very quick learner.<br>
				Once I am shown how to do something one-time and then that is it. 
				<h6 style="color:orange">Team player.</h6> I always work respectfully with my team and<br> find ways to support my co-workers in their goals.<br>
				<h6>Reliable.</h6> I always come to work on time and focus on the work at hand.
				<br> My employers can count on my reliability and my hard work.</p>
